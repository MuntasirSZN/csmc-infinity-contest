# Specification Quality Checklist: CSMC Infinity Contest Registration System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-15  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality ✅

- Specification focuses entirely on what users need and business outcomes
- No technology stack mentioned (frameworks, databases, languages)
- Language is accessible to non-technical stakeholders
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) completed

### Requirement Completeness ✅

- All 18 functional requirements are specific, testable, and unambiguous
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present—all decisions made with reasonable defaults
- Success criteria include 10 measurable, technology-agnostic metrics
- 8 acceptance scenarios defined across 3 user stories
- 10 edge cases identified for future handling
- Scope clearly bounded to registration system only
- Assumptions section documents all defaults and constraints

### Feature Readiness ✅

- Each functional requirement maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- User stories prioritized (P1 core registration, P2 enhancements)
- All stories are independently testable and deliverable
- Success criteria can be verified without knowing implementation
- Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` command

## Notes

**Validation completed successfully** - All checklist items pass. Specification is complete, clear, and ready for planning phase.

Key strengths:

- Clear user journey prioritization (P1: registration, P2: validation & returning visitors)
- Comprehensive edge case identification
- Measurable, user-focused success criteria
- Well-documented assumptions for ambiguous aspects
- Technology-agnostic throughout

Ready to proceed with `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify` if additional user input is needed.
